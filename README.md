# İnceseslem - Turkish Phonetic Transcriptor

*  The phonetic transcriptor function was first written for the 'İncesöz' project in 2024 and is now being used for its own Python package for easier deployment and usability.
The function was first developed using the Özgün Koşaner's lecture notes from the Phonetics class at Dokuz Eylul University's Linguistics department.

## Usage ##
* To use it, simply import the Python package and write the "inceseslem.phonetic_analysis('')" line of code. 
Finally, put the Turkish word you want to transcript in the quotation marks and run the code


"""py
import inceseslem

print(inceseslem.phonetic_analysis('enis tuna burada mı?'))
"""
